Developing interactivity in your website pages will require you, to build a portion of it with javascript.  If that javascript needs to perform its actions when the DOM has finished loading, you have several options depending on if you are using a javascript library or not.  If you're going the non-library route, you can do the following:<a id="more"></a><a id="more-1026"></a>

``` javascript
   window.onload = function() {
      // do something now that the dom is loaded
   }
```

The caveat here, is that based on what gets loaded first, you'll have to ensure that you take into account any other code that needs to be post-DOM loaded.  I would suggest using a library regardless, they make life oh so much more simple.

First example is using <a href="http://mootools.net/" target="_blank">mootools</a>:

``` javascript
   window.addEvent('domready', function() {
        // do something now that the dom is loaded
   }
```

Here's an example using <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jquery</a>:

``` javascript
   $(document).ready(function() {
      // do something now that the dom is loaded
   }
```

And finally here's an example using <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/" target="_blank">prototype</a>:

``` javascript
   document.observe("dom:loaded", function() {
      // do something now that the dom is loaded
   }
```

So go forth, and remember the proper order of operations.  No inlining your javascript folks!
