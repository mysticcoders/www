Looks like another fun filled latter half of the year.  Andrew will be speaking at two more conferences this year and speaking about Web technology more specifically HTML5 and <a href="http://wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Wicket</a>.  I highly recommend both conferences if you're close, or want to take a nice vacation to really awesome spots.

The first conference is in Sofia, Bulgaria named <a href="http://2010.java2days.com" target="_blank">Java2Days</a>.  The team that puts this conference on does a wonderful job, the speakers they've rounded up are all top notch and you'll notice that several of last years are coming back.  Great group of attendees as well, with lots of interesting and engaging questions to be asked.  Looking forward to this one for sure!

The second conference is in Ft Lauderdale, Florida and is put on by the No Fluff Just Stuff crew named <a href="http://www.therichwebexperience.com" target="_blank">The Rich Web Experience 2010</a>.  If uberconf was any indication as to how awesome a conference the NFJS crew can put on, this one will be jam packed all day full of amazing information.  Top notch speakers, great venue, definitely something to pencil in if web technology is something you're interested in.

That'll round out the year, hope to see you at a conference soon.  And if you need any custom development, speaking at your conference or training please <a href="http://www.mysticcoders.com/contact-us">contact us today</a>.
