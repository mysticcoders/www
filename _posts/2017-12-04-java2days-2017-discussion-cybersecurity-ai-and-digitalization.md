When I was at Java2Days this year, I was pulled into a panel discussion about Cybersecurity, AI and Digitalization. The discussion 
ranged in talks about privacy, e-voting, and if artificial intelligence will take your job as a developer. 

As a true lover of Star Wars, I was wearing my AT-AT shirt which you can [find at Target](https://www.target.com/p/men-s-star-wars-174-at-at-t-shirt/-/A-15447392).

Here's a quick shot from the Target website, and it looks awesome:

The other participants on the panel were: 

* Linda Naeun Lee from [Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/)
* Steve Kosten ([@skosten](https://twitter.com/skosten)) from [Cypress Data Defense](https://www.cypressdatadefense.com/)
* Aaron Cure ([@curea](https://twitter.com/curea)) from [Puma Security](https://www.pumascan.com/)
* Krasimir Kotsev

What do you think about the challenges we're currently facing with cybersecurity and privacy? Or the constant drumbeat of machine learning and 
AI getting ever closer to replacing what once was human-only functions? Let us know in the comments.
