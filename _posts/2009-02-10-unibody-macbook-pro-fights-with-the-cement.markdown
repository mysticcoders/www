and it lost this round.

I was on the phone, with one of our kick ass java wizards talking about one of our projects, when it happened. I don't know what the cement said to my beloved Macbook Pro to make it so angry, whatever it was it made her very very angry. And you won't like her when she's angry. The MBP slid off of its "secure" holder, and got hit square in the lip. The scuff marks on the beautiful unibody not at issue, but the separation in the battery / hard drive cover definitely is.

I rushed her to the <a title="Apple Store Retail" href="http://www.apple.com/retail">Apple Store</a> with my <a title="Apple Store Procare" href="http://www.apple.com/retail/procare/">ProCare</a> card in tow, and they examined. Patiently waiting, wondering, hope filled ... yes we can ... fix it. And due to my <a title="Apple Store Procare" href="http://www.apple.com/retail/procare/">ProCare</a> member status, it would only take a few days, and $350 + tax. Not bad for a trip to Apple Store emergency. The machine is going in for plastic surgery on Thursday night, and I'm told, I can pick it up on Monday.
