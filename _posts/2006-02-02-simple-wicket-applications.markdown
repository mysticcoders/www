I will be preparing a full tutorial on building a simple but functional application using <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a>.  Here are two applications which were built in a very short amount of time, with the very simple framework.

<blockquote><a href="http://www.papernapkin.org/pastebin">Pastebin</a> is homage to the several applications built before it, and was built in a few hours time at most.  It has the distinction of being the pastebin for irc.freenode.net's ##java, ##wicket, and ##swing!</blockquote>

<blockquote><a href="http://www.mysticcoders.com/lounge">Mystic Lounge</a> is a file delivery system!  Ok, its just a form giving you upload capability for larger files that you otherwise wouldn't be able to email.</blockquote>
We have a lot more projects in the works over here at Mystic, these are just some simple apps that we coded up to learn the internals of <a href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a>.
