It took just over a week for apple to approve it, but we're in.  I decided to learn a little Objective-C in my spare time and built this simple app, it's a counter which you tap to increment.  You can save multiple counters, name them, date them, and it saves your place in between stops and starts, and even power cycles.

Special thanks go to my brother <a href="http://www.daniellombardi.com">Daniel</a> for designing the logo, my illustrious beta testing crew which includes my wonderful parents, and all of you who will download the app ... give it great reviews, 5 stars, and send me your ideas for updates.
