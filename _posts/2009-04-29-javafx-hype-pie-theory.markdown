It would seem that Sun^HOracle is actually able to think outside the box a bit.  The latest way they're trying to get folks to learn JavaFX, is by a new online interactive game called <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/ontherecord/entry/pie_theory" target="_blank">PIE Theory</a>.  The idea is that you follow along with our two heroes, and help them unlock clues based on performing some tasks using JavaFX syntax?  and generally learning more about the language.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-832"></a>

Hats off for an interesting way to show off the technology, and I think it aims at an age group that will really enjoy the thought put into it.  Now if you'll excuse me, I've got some JavaFX to learn so I can help Baron and Hector!
